# Source Map Support
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/evanw/node-source-map-support.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/evanw/node-source-map-support)

This module provides source map support for stack traces in node via the [V8 stack trace API](https://github.com/v8/v8/wiki/Stack-Trace-API). It uses the [source-map](https://github.com/mozilla/source-map) module to replace the paths and line numbers of source-mapped files with their original paths and line numbers. The output mimics node's stack trace format with the goal of making every compile-to-JS language more of a first-class citizen. Source maps are completely general (not specific to any one language) so you can use source maps with multiple compile-to-JS languages in the same node process.

## Installation and Usage

#### Node support

```
$ npm install source-map-support
```

Source maps can be generated using libraries such as [source-map-index-generator](https://github.com/twolfson/source-map-index-generator). Once you have a valid source map, place a source mapping comment somewhere in the file (usually done automatically or with an option by your transpiler):

```
//# sourceMappingURL=path/to/source.map
```

If multiple sourceMappingURL comments exist in one file, the last sourceMappingURL comment will be
respected (e.g. if a file mentions the comment in code, or went through multiple transpilers).
The path should either be absolute or relative to the compiled file.

From here you have two options.

##### CLI Usage

```bash
node -r source-map-support/register compiled.js
```

##### Programmatic Usage

Put the following line at the top of the compiled file.

```js
require('source-map-support').install();
```

It is also possible to install the source map support directly by
requiring the `register` module which can be handy with ES6:

```js
import 'source-map-support/register'

// Instead of:
import sourceMapSupport from 'source-map-support'
sourceMapSupport.install()
```
Note: if you're using babel-register, it
